        I am specializes in providing relevant content for websites. Every
        website has a specific target audience and requires the most relevant
        content to attract business. Content should contain keywords (specific
        business-related terms, which internet users might use in order to
        search for services or products) aimed towards improving a website's
        SEO. A website content writer who also has knowledge of the SEO process
        is referred to as an SEO Content Writer.

        Most story pieces are centered on marketing products or services, though
        this is not always the case. Some websites are informational only and do
        not sell a product or service. These websites are often news sites or
        blogs. Informational sites educate the reader with complex information
        that is easy to understand and retain.

        We aims for relevance and search-ability. Relevance means that the
        website text should be useful and beneficial to readers. Search-ability
        indicates usage of keywords to help search engines direct users to
        websites that meet their search criteria. There are various ways through
        which websites come up with article writing, and one of them is
        outsourcing of the content writing. However, it is riskier than other
        options, as not all writers can write content specific to the web.
